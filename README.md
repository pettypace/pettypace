- Hi, I’m @pettypace
- I’ve built an online calculator (in PHP) for estimating bullet penetration and permanent cavity mass in 10% ballistic gelatin. I call this program VIRGEL which is a recursive acronym for VIRGEL isn't really gelatin. This program can be found here: http://snubbyfest.000webhostapp.com/virgel.php?N=4&U=1&D=.45&W=230&V=850&id=45+ACP+FMJ

-VIRGEL is based on the ideas and concepts of Duncan MacPherson (in his book "Bullet Penetration") and on the simplified THOR equation as described by Charles Schwartz (in his book "Quantitative Ammunition Selection").

- Now, I'd like to build a similar program, using (I think) Processing 3, so that users can have a standalone calculator that will not require internet access.
